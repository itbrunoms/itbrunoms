## Hey There 👋

Hello! I'm Bruno, a full-stack software architect with hands-on experience in software development since 2018. I currently specialize in PHP, Laravel, and Flutter, but I’ve also worked with a wide range of technologies across web and mobile platforms, such as Node.js, React, Next.js, and more. I truly believe that when you have a solid understanding of programming logic and analytical thinking, you can develop in any language—even Java! 😄 I design and build scalable, maintainable systems—ranging from enterprise solutions and APIs to mobile apps and whitelabel platforms. 

I'm passionate about clean code, architecture, and solving real-world problems through technology. 🚀

I'm currently based in Brazil 🇧🇷, but I'm exploring new horizons worldwide. 🔍🌍

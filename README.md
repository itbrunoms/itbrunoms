## Hey There 👋

Hello! I'm Bruno, a full-stack software architect and senior software developer with hands-on experience in software development since 2018. I specialize in PHP, Laravel, and Flutter, but also have strong experience with modern web and mobile technologies like Node.js, React, Next.js, and Docker.

I build scalable, maintainable systems—from enterprise applications, RESTful APIs, and microservices architectures to mobile apps and whitelabel platforms. I’m passionate about clean code, software architecture, design patterns, and solving real-world problems with technology.

I’m currently based in Brazil 🇧🇷, but I’m open to remote opportunities, international roles, and relocation. 🔍🌍

📫 Check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arquiteto-software-bruno) to learn more about my journey and the projects I’ve been involved in.
